The program is fully complete but it does not work on multiple machines.

The code is completely self-documenting. I added a color coding
that colors every user a different color.

In order to get multiple machines to work the ChatServer is going to ask you
to input your IPv4 address. In order to do this you are going to have to do
ip addr in the Linux terminal. Using this as an argument for ChatServer and 
on your other machines run ChatClient. The printed IP Address and Port 
on the ChatServer machine is going to be your 2 arguments. This should allow you 
to chat between multiple machines.

I made it look less spartan which should also be considered during grading.
